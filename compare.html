                      How hard is it to get into Harvard and can I get accepted? The
                      acceptance rate at Harvard is 5% ranking #1 in Massachusetts
                      for lowest rate of acceptance. Last year, 2,015 out of 40,248
                      applicants were admitted making Harvard an extremely
                      competitive school to get into with a very low chance of
                      acceptance – even for applicants with the highest scores and
                      grades.
                      <br /><br />
                      The school has exceptionally high admission requirements for
                      SAT and ACT scores, generally admitting students who score in
                      the top 2 percent (SAT 1460/1580 ACT 33/35). Harvard
                      University typically accepts and attracts “A” average high
                      school students with an average GPA around 4.0. Most incoming
                      freshmen graduate in the top ten percent of their high school
                      class. Of those applicants who were admitted, 70% enrolled.
                      With over half of admitted students enrolling, acceptance by
                      Harvard University is a prized outcome for many students.

                      How hard is it to get into Harvard and can I get accepted? The
                      acceptance rate at Harvard is 5% ranking #1 in Massachusetts
                      for lowest rate of acceptance. Last year, 2,015 out of 40,248
                      applicants were admitted making Harvard an extremely
                      competitive school to get into with a very low chance of
                      acceptance – even for applicants with the highest scores and
                      grades.
                      <br /><br />
                      The school has exceptionally high admission requirements for
                      SAT and ACT scores, generally admitting students who score in
                      the top 2 percent (SAT 1460/1580 ACT 33/35). Harvard
                      University typically accepts and attracts “A” average high
                      school students with an average GPA around 4.0. Most incoming
                      freshmen graduate in the top ten percent of their high school
                      class. Of those applicants who were admitted, 70% enrolled.
                      With over half of admitted students enrolling, acceptance by
                      Harvard University is a prized outcome for many students.

                      How hard is it to get into Harvard and can I get accepted? The
                      acceptance rate at Harvard is 5% ranking #1 in Massachusetts
                      for lowest rate of acceptance. Last year, 2,015 out of 40,248
                      applicants were admitted making Harvard an extremely
                      competitive school to get into with a very low chance of
                      acceptance – even for applicants with the highest scores and
                      grades.
                      <br /><br />
                      The school has exceptionally high admission requirements for
                      SAT and ACT scores, generally admitting students who score in
                      the top 2 percent (SAT 1460/1580 ACT 33/35). Harvard
                      University typically accepts and attracts “A” average high
                      school students with an average GPA around 4.0. Most incoming
                      freshmen graduate in the top ten percent of their high school
                      class. Of those applicants who were admitted, 70% enrolled.
                      With over half of admitted students enrolling, acceptance by
                      Harvard University is a prized outcome for many students.

                      How hard is it to get into Harvard and can I get accepted? The
                      acceptance rate at Harvard is 5% ranking #1 in Massachusetts
                      for lowest rate of acceptance. Last year, 2,015 out of 40,248
                      applicants were admitted making Harvard an extremely
                      competitive school to get into with a very low chance of
                      acceptance – even for applicants with the highest scores and
                      grades.
                      <br /><br />
                      The school has exceptionally high admission requirements for
                      SAT and ACT scores, generally admitting students who score in
                      the top 2 percent (SAT 1460/1580 ACT 33/35). Harvard
                      University typically accepts and attracts “A” average high
                      school students with an average GPA around 4.0. Most incoming
                      freshmen graduate in the top ten percent of their high school
                      class. Of those applicants who were admitted, 70% enrolled.
                      With over half of admitted students enrolling, acceptance by
                      Harvard University is a prized outcome for many students.

              </h4>
              <p>
                Harvard University typically prefers applicants to be in the top
                2 percent of SAT test takers. The school consistently takes SAT
                composite scores down to 1460 on a 1600 scale, below which
                admission should be considered a reach. We estimate some
                students could be accepted with SAT’s as low as 1400. The
                estimated average SAT composite for admitted freshman is 1520
                out of 1600. The school ranks #2 in Massachusetts for highest
                average SAT composite score. A competitive SAT score is critical
                as 69 percent of applicants submit SAT scores to the school.

                What are the SAT requirements for students to be admitted to
                Harvard University?

              <p>
                Harvard University typically prefers applicants to be in the top
                2 percent of SAT test takers. The school consistently takes SAT
                composite scores down to 1460 on a 1600 scale, below which
                admission should be considered a reach. We estimate some
                students could be accepted with SAT’s as low as 1400. The
                estimated average SAT composite for admitted freshman is 1520
                out of 1600. The school ranks #2 in Massachusetts for highest
                average SAT composite score. A competitive SAT score is critical
                as 69 percent of applicants submit SAT scores to the school.
